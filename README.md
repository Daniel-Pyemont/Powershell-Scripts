# Powershell-Scripts
List of powershell scripts I used to help with my work


1. ShowAllGroupsFromAUser.ps1 Script.

Shows All the shared folders a user has access to (Same as if you are going to AD > User > MemberOf Tab).

2. RemotelyRemoveUserProfile.ps1 Script.

This Remotely connects to users computer that is on the same network, and their profile, it deletes it, and windows creates a new one once they log back in, WARNING: THIS DELETES EVERYTHING - MAKE SURE USER HAS STUFF BACKED UP!!!!!!!!
